### Lessons Learned
- How to initialize vectors with a certain size(with_capacity)
- The difference between Option and Result
- How to work with external crates(rand crate)
- 0..len is exclusive where as 0..=len in inclusive
- I found the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm definitely interesting
- Needed to put documentation and extra structs in the wordy assignment for simplicity and readability

### Things that didn't go well
- I couldn't pass all my tests for the crypto-square assignment because of a weird panic error I was getting
- I wouldn't say this didn't go well because I passed all of the tests, but if I had more time I would optimize the protein translation assignment by using a hash table instead of reusing the vector itself

### Additional thoughts
- I'm excited that I'm starting to apply additional concepts into my program(impl, struct, enum, etc) because it's slowly helping me build more modular and cleaner code as we progress through the hw assignments
